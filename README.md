# About this space

This repository is a collaborative space for RSG and California/Bay Area agencies working on TNC studies. All parties can use this space to document and contribute to dataset review & requests and potentially share scripts or other documents as needed.

No data (particularly no personal data) should be hosted on GitHub! This is intended only for documentation and scripts.

## Issue tracking
Please add and label issues as they come up during dataset/documentation review and discussion. It's helpful to group or tag related requests/issues when applicable.

Categories of "issues":
- Codebook-related (label "labeling"): Something is mis-labeled or unclearly labeled; a value or variable isn't in the codebook
- Data issues (label "error"): Something is wrong/erroneous in the dataset (e.g., a negative trip duration, trips illogically unlinked, etc.) Might pertain to a specific record or variable, or be methodology-related.
- Requests/features (label "enhancement"): Additional fields or levels of data that can be derived from what was collected (e.g., linked trips table, block group of trip destination, etc.) Again may pertain to a methodology (doing additional steps) or a specific field (adding a derived variable).
