# About this space

This repository is a collaborative space for RSG and California/Bay Area agencies working on TNC studies. All parties can use this space to document and contribute to dataset review & requests and potentially share scripts or other documents as needed.

No data (particularly no personal data) should be hosted on GitHub! This is intended only for documentation and scripts.
